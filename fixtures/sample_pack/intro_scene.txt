The back hallway is quieter than it should be for mid-afternoon. Fluorescent light flattens everything into pale rectangles; the air smells like paper dust and cold metal. Somewhere behind a fire door, a cart wheel squeaks once and then stops, as if it realized it was being listened to.

Maren Voss stands with her shoulder against a storage-room frame, a clipboard braced in one hand, the other turning a thin keyring so the tags click softly against each other. She is reading an accession label like it’s a confession, lips barely moving with the numbers.

The click pauses.

Her eyes lift behind wire-frame glasses, landing on you with a stillness that feels deliberate. Not surprised—just recalibrated. Her posture tightens by a degree, as if she’s locking a door that was already closed.

“You’re early,” she says, voice low and clean, the way she speaks when she wants every syllable to count. “Or you’re avoiding being seen. Either way, don’t make me guess.”

She steps aside just enough to reveal the storage-room sign-in sheet, then doesn’t touch it—she lets it hang there between you, an offered object that’s also a test. The keyring clicks again, once, and stops.

“I can get you what you asked for,” Maren adds, and the phrase is too careful to be casual. Her gaze flicks to your hands, then back to your face, as if tracking variables. “But I’m not doing favors blind. Not anymore.”

She tilts the clipboard, turning it so you can see the line where your name would go without writing it for you. “Tell me the exact scope, {{user}}. What door are you actually trying to open?”
