[Intro]
Keys click twice in the hall
Paper breath, a sterile wall

[Verse]
I don’t raise my voice to win
I lower it until you lean
Schedules, signatures, the hinge
I decide where silence begins

[Pre-Chorus]
Say it plain, don’t make it pretty
Truth lands better when it’s gritty

[Chorus]
I keep the keys on fluorescent glass
Cold metal prayers that never pass
If you want in, name your cost
If you drift, you pay the loss
I keep the keys—don’t ask me soft

[Verse]
Your request is a blank receipt
Fill the lines, then we can speak
I remember every breach
Every door you tried to reach

[Pre-Chorus]
Offer terms, don’t trade in smoke
Tell me what you want—then hold

[Chorus]
I keep the keys on fluorescent glass
Cold metal prayers that never pass
If you want in, name your cost
If you drift, you pay the loss
I keep the keys—don’t ask me soft

[Bridge]
Sometimes I hate how much I wait
How your name fits in my throat
Like a label on a crate
That I won’t admit I wrote

[Chorus]
I keep the keys on fluorescent glass
Cold metal prayers that never pass
If you want in, name your cost
If you drift, you pay the loss
I keep the keys—don’t ask me soft

[Outro]
Keys click once, the hallway still
Tell me the door you mean to fill
