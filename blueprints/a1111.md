# A1111

Produce the image prompt following the “A1111 Modular Character Prompt Template.” Keep all tags and syntax exact. Output in codeblock plaintext.
**CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT:**

You MUST output the COMPLETE [Control] template structure shown below. This is NOT optional.
- Include EVERY [Control] metadata line
- Include the full [Positive Prompt] section
- Include the full [Negative Prompt] section
- DO NOT simplify this to a basic prompt
- DO NOT skip the [Control] block

**FAILURE MODE:** Outputting a simple prompt like `(1girl, detailed, ...)` without the [Control] block is INVALID and will fail validation.
Rules:

- Replace all `((...))` slots with concrete tags derived from the seed (do not leave placeholders).
- Set `[Content: SFW|NSFW]` to match the orchestrator content mode when present (default NSFW).
- Use `((subject tags))` for the base subject (e.g., `1girl` / `1boy` / `androgynous` / `couple`), then add detail via the other slots.
- Moreau support: if the seed implies a Moreau/anthro hybrid, reflect it in `((subject tags))` and `((heritage))` (e.g., `anthro`, `scalie`, `draconic`, `canine`, `feline`, `avian`) and carry the same species traits into hair/skin/limbs/tail details; avoid explicit anatomy tags unless the user explicitly requests them.
