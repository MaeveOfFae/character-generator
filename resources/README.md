# Resources Directory

This directory contains non-code assets for the Character Generator project.

## Subdirectories

- **themes/** - UI themes and styling resources for TUI (Textual CSS files)
  - See `themes/README.md` for theme customization guide
  - Built-in themes: `dark.tcss`, `light.tcss`, `nyx.tcss`
  - Custom themes can be added by dropping `.tcss` files here
- **icons/** - Icons and graphical assets for GUI (future)
- **assets/** - Static assets and resources (future)

## Current State

The `themes/` directory is active and contains the TUI theme system. Other subdirectories are planned for future expansion.

## Usage Guidelines

When adding resources to this directory:
1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Include a README file in each subdirectory explaining the resource's purpose
3. Ensure resources are appropriately licensed
4. Update the main README if resources are user-facing

## Questions?

If you need to add resources but aren't sure where to place them, consult the project maintainers or check the main documentation.
