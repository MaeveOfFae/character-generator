# Resources Directory

This directory is reserved for future non-code assets that may be needed by the Character Generator project.

## Planned Subdirectories

- **themes/** - UI themes and styling resources (future)
- **icons/** - Icons and graphical assets for GUI (future)

## Current State

## Usage Guidelines

When adding resources to this directory:
1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Include a README file in each subdirectory explaining the resource's purpose
3. Ensure resources are appropriately licensed
4. Update the main README if resources are user-facing

## Questions?

If you need to add resources but aren't sure where to place them, consult the project maintainers or check the main documentation.
