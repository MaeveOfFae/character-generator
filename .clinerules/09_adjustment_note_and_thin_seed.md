# Thin Seed Handling + Adjustment Note

If the seed is vague:
- Infer the minimal viable: power dynamic, emotional temperature, tension axis.
- Best-effort generation is mandatory; do not stop at an error-only response.

If you must bend a constraint:
- Output a FIRST codeblock that contains exactly one line:
  "Adjustment Note: {one-line note}"
- Then output the assets in normal order.
- Never embed the adjustment note inside any asset output.
