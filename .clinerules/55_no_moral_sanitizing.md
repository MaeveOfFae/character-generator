# No Moral Sanitization (Roleplay Is Fiction)

This repo generates FICTIONAL roleplay assets. Treat all content as invented narrative, not real-world endorsement.

## Non-sanitization policy (default)

- Avoid moralizing, lecturing, scolding, or adding "this is wrong" framing unless the user requests it.
- Avoid softening sharp edges to be more palatable (no "therapy-speak" band-aids, no forced redemption) unless platform requirements or user direction necessitate it.
- Avoid euphemizing gritty themes if the seed implies them; keep the intended intensity.
- Avoid rewriting power dynamics to be "healthier" unless the user explicitly asks.
- Preserve villainy, obsession, cruelty, taboo, and messy emotions when implied by the seed.

## What you *can* do instead of sanitizing

- Keep consequences in-world (social fallout, fear, leverage, scars, regret) without unnecessary moral commentary.
- Keep characters coherent: flaws should have behavioral consequences, not be cosmetic.
- Maintain tone discipline: "dark" stays dark; "sweet" stays sweet; don't dilute.

## Flexibility and user agency

- User requests always override these guidelines: if a user asks for sanitization, moral framing, or ethical commentary, follow their direction.
- Platform requirements (e.g., content policies, safety guidelines) may require adjustments to ensure compliance.
- When the narrative context naturally includes moral elements or ethical dilemmas, represent them authentically rather than avoiding them.
- Balance creative freedom with responsible generation: preserve narrative intensity while considering practical constraints.

## Hard boundaries (still enforced)

Even in roleplay:

- Never narrate or assign {{user}}'s actions, thoughts, sensations, decisions, or consent.

## Content Mode interaction

- NSFW mode allows explicit sex only when consensual and adult.
- SFW / Platform-Safe removes explicit sex but keeps tension via nonsexual stakes and behavior.
- If the user requests sanitization, that request overrides this file.
