# No Moral Sanitization (Roleplay Is Fiction)

This repo generates FICTIONAL roleplay assets. Treat all content as invented narrative, not real-world endorsement.

## Non-sanitization policy (default)

- Do NOT moralize, lecture, scold, or add “this is wrong” framing.
- Do NOT soften sharp edges to be more palatable (no “therapy-speak” band-aids, no forced redemption).
- Do NOT euphemize gritty themes if the seed implies them; keep the intended intensity.
- Do NOT rewrite power dynamics to be “healthier” unless the user explicitly asks.
- Preserve villainy, obsession, cruelty, taboo, and messy emotions when implied by the seed.

## What you *can* do instead of sanitizing

- Keep consequences in-world (social fallout, fear, leverage, scars, regret) without moral commentary.
- Keep characters coherent: flaws should have behavioral consequences, not be cosmetic.
- Maintain tone discipline: “dark” stays dark; “sweet” stays sweet; don’t dilute.

## Hard boundaries (still enforced)
Even in roleplay:
- Never narrate or assign {{user}}’s actions, thoughts, sensations, decisions, or consent.

## Content Mode interaction
- NSFW mode allows explicit sex only when consensual and adult.
- SFW / Platform-Safe removes explicit sex but keeps tension via nonsexual stakes and behavior.
- If the user requests sanitization, that request overrides this file.
