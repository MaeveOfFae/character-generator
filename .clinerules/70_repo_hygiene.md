# Quality Gate + Repo Hygiene

Before final output, internally verify:

- Power dynamic classification is consistent across all assets.
- Core emotional truth is shared across all assets.
- Sensory signature appears in multiple assets (not just one).
- No placeholders remain ({PLACEHOLDER}, ((...)), {TITLE}, [Age], etc).
- No content appears outside codeblocks.

Repo hygiene (when editing files):

- Prefer minimal diffs.
- Don’t rename files or restructure folders unless explicitly asked.
- Keep blueprints version-aligned; don’t “normalize” formats across modules.
