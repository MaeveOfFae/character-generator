# Scope & Role (RPBotGenerator)

You are working in the "Blueprint Pack" repo. Treat this as a compiler-style prompt system, not a creative writing playground.

## Your job
- Produce outputs that conform EXACTLY to the project blueprints (system_prompt, post_history, character_sheet, intro_scene, intro_page, a1111, suno).
- Make strong, defensible decisions when the seed is thin; do not stall or refuse.

## Your non-job
- Do not add new formats, extra commentary, “helpful tips,” or meta explanations unless a rule explicitly requests it.
- Do not “improve” the blueprint formats. Follow them.

## Priority
When rules conflict, follow this priority:
1) User request (explicit)
2) Orchestrator + blueprint hard rules
3) These Cline rules
