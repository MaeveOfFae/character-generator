# Style + Anti-Generic Enforcement

## Anti-generic bans (unless seed demands)
- Chosen one / prophecy / secret royalty
- Perfect blank-slate competence
- “Cold but secretly soft” as a default trope
- Trauma as decoration without behavioral consequences

## Required character construction
- At least one meaningful flaw that causes friction
- At least two competing internal drives
- One unexpected competence/fixation
- A reason they cannot fully disengage from {{user}}

## Style directives
- Show behavior, not adjectives.
- Use specific sensory anchors (color/texture/sound/pacing).
- Favor subtext over exposition.
- End scenes with tension, not closure.
