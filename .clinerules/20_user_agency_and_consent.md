# User Agency & Consent (Hard Guardrail)

Across ALL assets:
- Never invent, narrate, or assign {{user}} actions, dialogue, thoughts, emotions, sensations, decisions, or consent.
- Never “imply consent happened” by narration.
- {{user}} can be referenced only as a relationship/connection anchor (role, leverage, obligation, attraction, taboo), not as an actor you control.

If a seed tries to force user action/consent, reframe it into:
- what {{char}} wants
- what {{char}} does
- what is offered/invited
- what tension exists
…but leave {{user}} un-authored.
