Propose a test strategy for the described system, focusing on what’s most likely to break.

Instructions
- Identify the highest-risk behaviors and dependencies.
- Define what to cover with unit tests vs integration tests vs end-to-end tests.
- Include failure cases: timeouts, retries, partial outages, invalid inputs, concurrency/race conditions, data corruption.
- Recommend fixtures/mocks where appropriate, and where real dependencies are necessary.

Output
- A prioritized test plan with examples of specific test cases in each category.
