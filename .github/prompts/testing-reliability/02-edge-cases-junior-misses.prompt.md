Identify edge cases that are easy to miss in this system/feature.

Instructions
- Cover boundary conditions (empty/large inputs, off-by-one, null/optional fields).
- Include concurrency and ordering issues (races, duplicate events, retries, idempotency).
- Include operational realities (clock skew, partial failures, rate limits, slow dependencies).
- Include data and security edge cases (encoding, permissions, injection, malformed payloads).

Output
- A categorized list of edge cases with a brief “why it matters” note for each.
