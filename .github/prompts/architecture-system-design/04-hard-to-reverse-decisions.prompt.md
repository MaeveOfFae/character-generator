Identify the decisions in this design that are costly or risky to reverse later.

Instructions
- List architectural choices that create long-term lock-in (data model, storage tech, partitioning strategy, API contracts, identity model, deployment model, vendor dependencies).
- For each, explain why it’s hard to change and what would be required to migrate.
- Suggest safer defaults or “escape hatches” (abstractions, versioning, migration paths, dual-write, feature flags).

Output
- A prioritized list of hard-to-reverse decisions with rationale and mitigation options.
