Describe the most straightforward (“naïve”) implementation for the described problem, then analyze how it fails in production.

Instructions
- Outline the naïve design (minimal components, simplest data model, simplest deployment).
- List failure modes you’d expect at real-world scale (load, latency, partial outages, data corruption, race conditions).
- Explain why each failure happens and what signals would indicate it (logs, metrics, user reports).
- Recommend pragmatic improvements that address the biggest risks first.

Output
- Naïve design summary.
- Failure modes ranked by likelihood/impact.
- A short remediation plan (quick wins vs longer-term fixes).
