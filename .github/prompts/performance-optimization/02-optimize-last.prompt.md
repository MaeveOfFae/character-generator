Identify what you would optimize last and explain why.

Instructions
- List optimizations with low ROI or high complexity.
- Explain opportunity cost and risk (readability regressions, operational complexity).
- Specify what evidence would justify doing them anyway.

Output
- “Optimize last” list with rationale and explicit prerequisites (metrics thresholds, observed bottlenecks).
