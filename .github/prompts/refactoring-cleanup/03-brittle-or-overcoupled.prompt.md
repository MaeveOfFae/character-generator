Identify the brittle or over-coupled parts of the provided code/system.

Instructions
- Point out tight coupling between concerns (I/O + business logic, global state, hidden dependencies).
- Explain how brittleness would show up (hard to test, breaks with small changes, unclear invariants).
- Suggest decoupling steps (interfaces, dependency injection, layering, pure functions).

Output
- A list of brittle/coupled areas with specific refactoring recommendations.
