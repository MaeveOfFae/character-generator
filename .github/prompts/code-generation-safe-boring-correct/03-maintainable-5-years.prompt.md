Write the described code as if another developer will maintain it for 5 years.

Guidelines
- Optimize for readability and changeability over micro-optimizations.
- Keep modules/functions small, cohesive, and well-named.
- Prefer explicit interfaces and stable contracts.
- Avoid “magic” behavior; make configuration and defaults obvious.

Output
- Code that is easy to extend and test.
- A short note on the intended extension points and what should remain invariant.
