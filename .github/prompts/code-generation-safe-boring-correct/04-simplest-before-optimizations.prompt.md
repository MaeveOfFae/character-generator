Produce the simplest correct solution first, then discuss optimizations separately.

Instructions
- Start with the minimal, correct implementation that’s easy to understand.
- Only after correctness is established, list possible optimizations and when they matter.
- Do not complicate the initial implementation for hypothetical performance needs.

Output
- `Baseline` implementation.
- `Optimization notes` section (no premature refactors unless necessary).
