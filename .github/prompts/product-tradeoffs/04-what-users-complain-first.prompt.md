Predict what users will complain about first if this system fails or degrades.

Instructions
- Identify the most user-visible failure modes (latency, errors, wrong results, missing data, confusing UX).
- Explain likely user impact and how it will be reported.
- Suggest mitigations that reduce user pain (graceful degradation, clearer errors, fallbacks, status communication).

Output
- A ranked list of user-visible pain points with mitigation and monitoring suggestions.
