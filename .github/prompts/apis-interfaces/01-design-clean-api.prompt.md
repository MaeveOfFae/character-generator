Design a clean API for the described use case, prioritizing misuse-resistance.

Instructions
- Define the core resources and operations.
- Make invalid states unrepresentable where possible (types, required fields, explicit enums).
- Specify authentication/authorization expectations and failure behavior.
- Define error responses and validation rules clearly.

Output
- The proposed API surface (endpoints or function signatures) with brief rationale and example requests/responses (or call examples).
