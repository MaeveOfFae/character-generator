Define what this API must not allow.

Instructions
- List prohibited behaviors and states (unsafe defaults, privilege escalation, inconsistent resource updates, ambiguous semantics).
- Specify guardrails: validation rules, authz checks, rate limits, idempotency requirements, invariants.
- Include examples of misuse and how the API design prevents it.

Output
- A “must not allow” checklist mapped to concrete API constraints.
