Define the smallest API surface area that still solves the problem.

Instructions
- Identify the minimum set of operations required for the primary user journey.
- Remove optional features and “nice-to-haves” unless they unlock core value.
- Prefer composition over bespoke endpoints when possible.
- Ensure the minimal surface still supports validation, authz, and observability needs.

Output
- A minimal API proposal plus explicit non-goals for the first iteration.
