Given the provided code and observed behavior, diagnose the issue systematically.

Instructions
- List plausible causes in order of likelihood (not just a brainstorm).
- For each cause, explain the reasoning and what evidence would support it.
- Provide a concrete way to confirm or falsify it (specific logs to add, repro steps, metrics, breakpoints, experiments).
- Suggest the smallest safe fix for the most likely cause, and any follow-up hardening.

Output
- Ranked cause list with validation steps.
- Recommended fix + verification plan.
