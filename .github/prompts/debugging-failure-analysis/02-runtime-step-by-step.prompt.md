Explain what the provided code does at runtime, step by step.

Instructions
- Walk through the execution order and control flow.
- Track important state changes (variables, data structures, external calls).
- Call out asynchronous/concurrent behavior and timing assumptions.
- Note side effects (I/O, network, database writes, global state).
- Highlight where errors can occur and how they propagate (or don’t).

Output
- A sequential “runtime narrative” that matches actual execution.
