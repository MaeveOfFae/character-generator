Identify assumptions the provided code relies on that are not enforced.

Instructions
- Enumerate implicit assumptions (input shape, ordering, uniqueness, non-nullability, permissions, environment, timing).
- For each, explain how it could be violated and what the failure would look like.
- Recommend enforcement mechanisms (validation, assertions, types, invariants, schema constraints, retries/timeouts).

Output
- A list of assumptions with concrete enforcement recommendations.
