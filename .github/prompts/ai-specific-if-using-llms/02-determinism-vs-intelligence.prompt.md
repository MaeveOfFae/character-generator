Identify where determinism matters more than “intelligence” in this system.

Instructions
- List decisions that must be predictable and repeatable (policy enforcement, schemas, formatting, routing, access control, critical calculations).
- Define acceptance criteria that can be checked automatically.
- Suggest patterns to make outputs deterministic (templates, constrained decoding, schemas, post-validation, retries with fixed seeds where applicable).

Output
- A list of deterministic-critical areas with concrete enforcement/validation strategies.
