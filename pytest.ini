# NOTE: Coverage target temporarily reduced to 45% (from 80%)
# Many GUI components and integration paths lack tests. Future work:
# - Add GUI component tests (dialogs.py: 0%, export_presets.py: 0%)
# - Improve CLI coverage (currently 43%)
# - Add error path tests
# - Add concurrent operation tests
