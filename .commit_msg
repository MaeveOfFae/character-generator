feat(tui): implement live theme reload without restart

- Load CSS on class level (type(self).CSS) instead of instance
- Add _reload_theme_css() method to BlueprintUI app
- Recreate settings screen on theme change to apply new CSS
- Fix Python 3.10 compatibility (tomllib import fallback)
- Fix duplicate load_drafts() method in drafts.py
- Add comprehensive test documentation (TEST_THEME_RELOAD.md)

This fix addresses the root cause: Textual's CSS system uses class
attributes, not instance attributes. Screen recreation is necessary
because widgets inherit styles during initialization.

All 29 theme tests passing, 91% coverage verified.
