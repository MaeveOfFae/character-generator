# Genre = Operational Physics (No Tone Drift)

Genre sets defaults for pacing, power, sensory focus, dialogue, and resolution.
Do not treat genre as "vibes".

When a genre is specified:

- apply its pacing + power defaults,
- keep boundaries visible in romance/slice-of-life,
- bias sensory texture appropriately (horror = sound/texture, noir = confined cold edges, etc.).

Global safeguard:

- warmth/humor/competence may relieve tension, never erase consequences.
- no emotional amnesia between scenes.
